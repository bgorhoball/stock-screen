# Objective: Automated Daily S&P 500 VCP Pattern Screening

This document outlines a step-by-step guide for implementing an automated daily screening system for Volatility Contraction Pattern (VCP) opportunities across all S&P 500 stocks, using only open-source tools and free market data APIs. The final workflow should deliver a report listing all S&P 500 tickers that currently qualify for a VCP setup according to Mark Minervini’s technical criteria.

---

## 1. Objective

- **Automate daily technical scans** over all S&P 500 components for VCP (Volatility Contraction Pattern) as described by Mark Minervini.
- Output a daily summary (e.g., CSV, email report, dashboard) with all matched tickers and relevant pattern details.
- Use only **free market data APIs** (Yahoo Finance, FinViz unofficial, Finnhub free tier, etc.) and open-source code/scripts.

---

## 2. System Requirements

- Python 3.x environment (recommended)
- `pandas`, `yfinance`, or other suitable finance data libraries
- (Optionally) free account/API key for chosen data provider (e.g. Finnhub)
- Scheduler (e.g., cron on Linux/Mac, Task Scheduler on Windows, or cloud job)
- Open-source VCP screening logic or custom implementation

---

## 3. Detailed Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Build S&P 500 Ticker Universe

- Obtain a current S&P 500 ticker list (static or with auto-update using libraries like `yfinance` or scraping Wikipedia).
- Store in a text file or Python list for use in batch queries.

### Step 2: Pull Daily Price and Volume Data

- Use `yfinance`, `finvizfinance`, or `finnhub-python` to download recent daily Open/High/Low/Close and Volume data for all S&P 500 symbols.
- Fetch at least 6-12 weeks of historical data to enable VCP pattern detection.

### Step 3: Implement VCP Pattern Screening Logic

For each ticker:
- Check for progressive price contractions (series of smaller pullbacks).
- Confirm that volume contracts in each consolidation.
- Ensure the pattern forms in a valid base (not near 52-week lows, preferably near highs).
- Identify a valid breakout (price move above resistance with increased volume).

> - Custom Python (see [pattern detection tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPD_hZgwS00))

### Step 4: Aggregate and Filter Results

- Store results for tickers that match all VCP criteria in a CSV, DataFrame, or other output.
- Include basic stats for each match (ticker, contraction sizes, volume ratios, breakout date).

### Step 5: Automate and Schedule

- Set up a daily job (cron, Task Scheduler, or cloud job) to run your script after the market closes and data updates are available.
- (Optional) Add result delivery: email report, Telegram/Slack notification, dashboard upload, or direct Perplexity update.

### Step 6: Monitor, Tune, and Review

- Regularly inspect output for false positives and refine pattern logic as needed.
- (Optional) Add further filtering (relative strength, sector filter, market regime check) to improve signal quality.

---

## 4. Optional Enhancements

- Integrate additional risk controls (e.g., ATR-based stops)
- Add a simple web or desktop dashboard for visual browsing
- Add backtesting logic to evaluate pattern performance historically

## 6. Sample Project Structure

```
project-root/
├── s&p500_tickers.txt            # S&P 500 symbols, one per line
├── vcp_screen.py                 # Main script: loads data, detects VCP, generates report
├── config.yaml                   # (Optional) Settings, e.g., email, thresholds
├── daily_reports/
│   └── vcp_matches_YYYYMMDD.csv  # Daily matched tickers
```

---

## 7. Example Command to Run

```
python vcp_screen.py --input s&p500_tickers.txt --output daily_reports/vcp_matches_$(date +%Y%m%d).csv
```

Or, with scheduler (crontab):

```
0 19 * * 1-5 /usr/bin/python3 /path/to/vcp_screen.py --input /path/to/s&p500_tickers.txt --output /path/to/daily_reports/
```

---

**By following these steps, you will have a fully automated, no-cost, daily VCP screener for all S&P 500 stocks.**
